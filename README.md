Print the pattern and prepare your tools:

   * book and the printed pattern
   * pencil
   * ruler or triangle ruler
   * scissors

Now draw two vertical lines on every page of the book:

   * cut line: to where you cut
   * fold line: to where you fold

Use the pattern to mark the cut points. Cut horizontally from the mark to the cut line. Then fold. You can either fold the pattern to the inside or to the outside to achieve a different effect.
